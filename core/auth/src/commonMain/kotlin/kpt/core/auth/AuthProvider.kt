/**
 * Fork-customization seam for sign-in / sign-out / session-state management.
 *
 * The toolkit ships **no built-in authentication**: every screen runs without a login wall.
 * Forks that need authentication (e.g. self-hosted banking back-office, multi-tenant SaaS)
 * override the default [NoOpAuthProvider] binding in their app-module Koin DI with a real
 * implementation (Firebase Auth, OAuth2, JWT-backed REST, etc.).
 *
 * ## Why a single seam?
 *
 * Without this contract, every fork either has to:
 * 1. Modify framework files (drift across template upgrades), or
 * 2. Bolt session state onto each ViewModel individually (duplicates the auth-gate logic
 *    across the whole app).
 *
 * With this seam, the fork:
 * - Binds **one** `single<AuthProvider> { MyFirebaseAuthProvider() }` in their app module.
 * - All consumers (router gate, profile screen, sync workers) read `authState` from Koin.
 * - Template upgrades never touch `core/auth/` — the contract is stable.
 *
 * ## Default binding
 *
 * The default [NoOpAuthProvider] always reports [AuthState.Authenticated] and
 * `isConfigured = false`. Codepaths that branch on `isConfigured` can hide login-aware
 * UI until the fork wires a real provider.
 *
 * ## Contract notes
 *
 * - [authState] is a **hot** [StateFlow] — collectors get the current value on subscribe.
 * - [signIn] **must** update [authState] before returning [AuthResult.Success], so the UI
 *   observing the flow sees the transition atomically.
 * - [signOut] is suspending so implementations can flush server-side sessions / clear caches.
 * - [isConfigured] is `true` when the fork has wired a real provider. UI can use this to
 *   gate "Sign in" buttons (e.g. hide them entirely on toolkit builds with no auth).
 *
 * @see NoOpAuthProvider Default binding when fork ships without authentication
 * @see AuthState Sealed state vocabulary
 * @see AuthResult Sealed result vocabulary
