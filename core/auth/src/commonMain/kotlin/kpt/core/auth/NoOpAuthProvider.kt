/**
 * Default [AuthProvider] binding for forks that do **not** ship authentication.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 * - [authState] is a hot [StateFlow] permanently at [AuthState.Authenticated] — every consumer
 *   of the flow sees a logged-in user and the toolkit can render every screen without a login
 *   gate. This is the "no login wall" semantic of the open-source Money Toolkit.
 * - [isConfigured] is `false` — UI can use this to hide login-aware affordances (Sign In /
 *   Sign Out buttons, profile-picture chrome, multi-account switchers).
 * - [signIn] returns [AuthResult.Success] immediately without side effects.
 * - [signOut] is a no-op.
 *
 * Forks that need authentication override the [kpt.core.auth.di.authModule] binding
 * in their app module with a real provider:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // In fork's app Koin module
 * single<AuthProvider> { MyFirebaseAuthProvider(get(), get()) }
 * ```
 *
 * The binding is read by `MyFirebaseAuthProvider` consumers (router gate, settings screen,
 * sync worker scheduler) the same way the no-op provider was — no per-consumer changes needed.
 *
 * **TODO**: UserDataRepository integration — TODO — separate plan covers consuming
 * AuthProvider.authState from UserDataRepositoryImpl. Today, UserDataRepository derives
 * "is the user logged in?" from its own field; once that switch flips, the source of truth
 * moves to this provider and UserDataRepository becomes a downstream observer.
 *
 * @see AuthProvider The contract this class fulfils
